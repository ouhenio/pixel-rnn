# Pixel Recurrent Neural Networks

This is my attempt to implement the [Pixel Recurrent Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1601.06759.pdf) paper, a precursor of the UNet that begun the diffusion revolution.

Since the authors proposed different architectures to tackle their goal, I'll attempt to implement them one by one:

- [ ] Row LSTM
- [ ] Diagonal BiLSTM
- [ ] PixelCNN

Feel free to look at my code, and challenge me on my implementation methodology. :blush:
